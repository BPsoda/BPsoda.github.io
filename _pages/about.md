<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in automation(IEEE class). I will start PhD. at Tsinghua University, Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, advised by Prof. Yang Gao. I love to study how the digital world percepts and controls the physical world. So, my research interests are robotics and embodied AI.  


Favored programming language: Python, C++, Matlab. Like to program in an organized way: understandable variable names, clean comments, good file structure and git commit logs. Hate functions that written by other programmer but have no comments or docs.

[CoPa: General Robotic Manipulation through Spatial Constraints of Parts with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08248)

Haoxu Huang, Fanqi Lin, Yingdong Hu, Shengjie Wang, Yang Gao

[**Project Page**](https://copa-2024.github.io/)
- CoPa is a novel framework that incorporates common sense knowledge embedded within foundation vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, into the low-level robotic manipulation tasks. 
- CoPa is capable of handling diverse open-set instructions and objects in a zero-training manner.

# üíª Projects
## Make Illustrator Relationship Visible
[github](https://github.com/BPsoda/ICE2604-illustrator-knowledge-grapgh)  
The final project for course ICE2604(ÁîµÁ±ªÂ∑•Á®ãÂØºËÆ∫). It is a cooperation project led by me. This project includes:  
- *Scraper* We implemented a data scraper with Python and get information of illustrators and illustrations from [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net)
- *Database* The data are stored and organized in mysql.
- *Analyze & Visualization* We analyze the relationship among illustrators by tags attached to their works and followers. Then, we visualized these results as charts and a huge relation map.
- *Website* We designed an interactive website where users can look into statistics, search for illustrators and browse illustrations.

## A P2P BBS
[github](https://github.com/BPsoda/ComputerNetHomework)  
A BBS based on P2P network. Final project for Computer Network.

## Fundus Images Processing
Final project for Digital Image Processing.   
We first localize the macula lutea with CNN, the align and normalize the image. Next, the vessels are segmented with U-Net and are removed to get clean images with Fast Marching Method (FMM).
